# Kriging-DACE: A Python implementation of "DACE - A MATLAB kriging toolbox"
## üìñ Overview
This repository contains the source code for **Kriging-DACE**, a Python implementation of "DACE - A MATLAB kriging toolbox" (https://www.omicron.dk/dace.html). The implementation was made by **Bruno V. Pinho (principal) and Roymel R. Carpio** at the **Laboratory of Software Development for Process Control and Optimization (LADES)**, affiliated with the **Programa de Engenharia Qu√≠mica (PEQ), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).**

The purpose of this project is to provide a **Python version of the software package DACE (Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments)**, which is a Matlab toolbox for
working with kriging approximations to computer models.

This repository serves as a resource for **researchers, engineers, and practitioners** working in **Surrogate Modeling, Metamodeling, Simplified Modeling, and Data-Driven Modeling**.

## üöÄ Features
- Construct a kriging approximation model based on data.
- Use this approximation model as a surrogate for predictions.
